# SVM Breast Cancer Classification

## Objective
This project uses Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to classify breast cancer data into benign or malignant using both linear and RBF kernels.

## Dataset
[Breast Cancer Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/breast-cancer-dataset)

## Steps
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Feature scaling
- Dimensionality reduction using PCA
- SVM training (Linear & RBF)
- Hyperparameter tuning (C & gamma)
- Cross-validation and evaluation
- Visualization of decision boundaries

## Output
- Best parameters from GridSearchCV
- Accuracy and classification report
- Plots showing decision boundaries
